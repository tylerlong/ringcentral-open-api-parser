        Updates the existing subscription. The client application can extend/narrow
        the list of events for which it receives notifications within this subscription.
        If event filters are specified, calling this method modifies them for the
        existing subscription. The method also allows setting the subscription expiration time.
        If other than `events` and `expiresIn` parameters are passed in the request they will be ignored.
        If the request body is empty then the specified subscription will be just renewed without any
        event filter modifications and with default expiration time.

        This method can only delete numbers that meet one of the following requirements:
          - numbers that have `"usageType": "Inventory"`
          - `"Forwarded"` numbers
          - `"Forwarded Company"` numbers

        In other words, this method will not delete numbers which are in use on the account - extension direct numbers,
        main number, etc. It is possible to indicate phone numbers to be deleted using their IDs or exact string values
        in e.164 format. However, the same lookup method (by ID or by value) must be used for all numbers within the same API call.

      summary: "Swap Devices"
      description: |
        Replaces the user device with another device, which is assigned to an extension
        or is stored in the inventory of the same account.
        Currently, the following device types can be swapped - `HardPhone` and `OtherPhone`.

        Please note:

         - This method allows replacing a device itself, while a phone number,
           a digital Line and an emergency address associated with this device remain unchanged
           and will still work together in a chain with the replacement device.
         - If a target device is from the inventory, then a source device will be moved
           to the inventory, and a target device will be assigned to the current extension.
         - If a target device is currently assigned to another extension,
           then the devices will be just swapped.

      summary: "Supervise Call Party"
      description: |
        Allows to monitor a call party in 'Listen' mode. Input parameters
        are extension number of a monitored user and internal identifier of a supervisor's
        device. Call session and party identifiers should be specified in path. Please
        note that for this method dual channel audio flow is supported, which means
        that you need to make one more request for monitoring the second participant
        of a call. And as a result of each monitoring request the client receives
        SIP invite with the following header `p-rc-api-monitoring-ids` containing
        IDs of the monitored party and session. The flow is supported for calls with
        no more than 2 participants. Currently, this method is supported for Softphone/Hardphone devices
        only, since device IDs for WebRTC/Mobile apps cannot be obtained.

        Deletes extension(s) by ID(s). When an extension is being deleted
        the default API behavior is as follows:

        - user's direct numbers are preserved by becoming additional company numbers;
        - user's digital lines (both device & associated phone number) are deleted.

        You can change this behavior using the filters:

        - create unassigned extensions for each digital line of the deleted extension by
          setting the query parameter `savePhoneLines` to `true` in request path;
        - remove direct numbers of the deleted extension by setting the `savePhoneNumbers`
          query parameter to `false` in request path

        **Note!** Since this API is now deprecated, please use the following API method `DELETE /restapi/v2/accounts/{accountId}/extensions` for users deletion.

        Returns a list of supported features and the information on their

        be checked by providing `featureId` query parameter. Multiple values
        are supported in the format: `?featureId=Feature1&featureId=Feature2`.
        To get only available features in order to decrease response size,
        `availableOnly=true` query param can be specified. If a feature
        is available for the current user, `"available": true` is returned in
        response for the record with the corresponding feature ID. Otherwise,
        the additional attribute `reason` is returned with the appropriate code:
        - `ServicePlanLimitation` -  a feature is not included in account service plan;
        - `AccountLimitation` - a feature is turned off for account;
        - `ExtensionTypeLimitation` - a feature is not applicable for extension type;
        - `ExtensionLimitation` - a feature is not available for extension, e.g., additional license required;

        For changing status of a message send `readStatus` set to either 'Read' or 'Unread' in request.
        It is possible to restore a message and its attachments (if message status is 'Deleted') by sending
        `availability` attribute set to 'Alive' in request body. If a message is already in 'Purged' state
        then its attachments cannot be restored and the message itself is about to be physically deleted.

        Bulk syntax (both traditional and alternative one) is supported.

      description: |
        This API allows client applications to register a new subscription so that it
        can be notified of events when they occur on the platform.

        A subscription relates to a set of events that a client application would like
        to be informed of and the delivery channel by which they will be notified of
        those events. How subscriptions are established depends upon the notification
        channel the client application would like to use to receive the event
        notification. For example, to create a webhook a developer would create a
        subscription via a REST API call, while specifying a list of events or "event
        filters" to be notified of, a transport type of `WebHook`, and the address or
        URL to which they would like the webhook delivered.

        However, developers wishing to subscribe to a set of events via a WebSocket
        channel, would first connect to the WebSocket gateway, and then issue their
        subscription request over the WebSocket itself, as opposed to making a REST
        API call to this endpoint.

        While the protocol for establishing a subscription may vary depending upon
        the delivery channel for that subscription, the schemas used for representing
        a subscription are the same across all delivery modes.

        Subscriptions are currently limited to 20 subscriptions per user/extension (for particular application).

        RingCentral currently supports the following delivery modes for event subscriptions:

        * [WebHook](https://developers.ringcentral.com/guide/notifications/webhooks/quick-start) - to receive event notifications as an HTTP POST to a given URL
        * [WebSocket](https://developers.ringcentral.com/guide/notifications/websockets/quick-start) - to receive real-time events over a persistent WebSocket connection
        * [PubNub](https://developers.ringcentral.com/guide/notifications/push-notifications/quick-start) (deprecated) - to receive a push notification sent directly to a client application

        Developers should be aware that the PubNub delivery mode is currently
        deprecated and will be removed in 2024. Developers are encouraged to
        [migrate their client applications to use WebSockets](https://developers.ringcentral.com/guide/notifications/websockets/migration/)
        instead.

        Updates the existing subscription. The client application can extend or narrow
        the list of events for which it receives notifications within the current subscription.
        If event filters are specified, calling this method modifies them for the
        existing subscription. The method also allows one to set an expiration time for the
        subscription itself.

        If parameters other than `events` and `expiresIn` are specified in the request they will be ignored.
        If the request body is empty then the specified subscription will be renewed without any
        event filter modifications and using the default expiration time.

        If the request is sent with empty body, it just renews a subscription
        (so it is an equivalent of the `POST /restapi/v1.0/subscription/{subscriptionId}/renew`).

        Please note that `WebSocket` subscriptions cannot be updated via HTTP interface.

        This request is used to reply to already-posted content or to initiate a discussion. If authorized, the
        authenticated user will be used as the content author.

        Content will be created and pushed asynchronously to the channel. When the content is successfully pushed to
        the channel, the Content.Exported event will be reported.

        The account context of this request is determined by the RC Account Id associated with the access token provided

        Replying to customer content is usually possible unless the channel or conversation is read only. Composing
        content, on the contrary, depends on the channel itself.

        * The channel may not support it (and be purely reactive like Instagram, Messenger, etc.).

        * Some channels (usually public accounts like Twitter or Facebook pages) allow for the publishing of content
        without targeting specific individuals.

        * Some channels (usually non-public media) require specific targeting (phone number for SMS, email address
        for email, customer_id, etc.) to be able to create content. This is channel-specific and detailed under the
        generic parameters.

            Specifies if a meeting is password protected.

            By default, Instant and Scheduled bridges are not password protected. For default (PMI) bridge, password
            protection will be turned on and the password will be generated if it is not specified while creation.

            While creation to set password protection you should set this field to true and specify a password in the
            **password** field. If you want to change password or set password protection for an unprotected bridge,
            you should set this field to true and specify a password in the **password** field in the update operation.

            To make protected bridge as unprotected you should set this field to false in the update operation.
          example: true
        password:
          type: "string"

            Specifies a password if bridge meetings should be password protected (passwordProtected field is true).
            Besides that, if the field is specified in the request but **passwordProtected** field is missing then
            it means that **passwordProtected** field is set to true.

            For Partner Applications Internal identifier of an extension
            created by partner. The RingCentral supports mapping of accounts and
            stores the corresponding account ID/extension ID for each partner ID of
            a client application. In request URIs partner IDs are accepted instead
            of regular RingCentral native IDs as path parameters using `pid=XXX` clause.
            Though in response URIs contain the corresponding account IDs and extension
            IDs. In all request and response bodies these values are reflected via
            partnerId attributes of account and extension
        permissions:
